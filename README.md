Character based transformer NLP model. Contructed via Karpathy tutorial. It would be reccomended to use a GPU with CUDA to run the model with the current hyperparameters. For reference with PyTorch for CUDA version 11.7 and an RTX 2080 Super, the model takes roughly 25 minutes to run in current form.
